# Backend for AI-Powered Event Map Builder

Built with Python, FastAPI, and Pydantic.

Consists of multiple API routes to fetch events, query OpenAI for results, and facilitate map submission and fetching between the React/JavaScript frontend (https://github.com/Zakaria-Arshad/build-event-map-frontend) and MongoDB.

Acts as a psuedo-middleware by utilizing the SeatGeek and OpenAI APIs, and formatting the data in a way that the frontend can effectively use it.
